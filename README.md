# libft

 - It is forbidden to declare global variables.
 - If you need subfunctions to write a complex function, you should define these sub- functions as static to avoid publishing them with your library. It would be a good habit to do this in your future projects as well.
 - Submit all files in the root of your repository.
 - It is forbidden to submit unused files.
 - Every .c must compile with flags.
 - You must use the command ar to create your library, using the command libtool is forbidden.

## first part
In this first part, you must re-code a set of the libc functions, as defined in their man. Your functions will need to present the same prototype and behaviors as the orig- inals. Your functions’ names must be prefixed by “ft_”. For instance strlen becomes ft_strlen.
